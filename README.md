### R G B (color channels) values are continous values between 0.0-1.0, so we need for use float becuase of the decimals.
### _bounces is an int because it's counting how many times the balls has bounced, which can only be in whole numbers (0,1,2). Float is not needed because a ball cannot bounces 1.3 times.
### I'm not sure what the original code looked like...I just know I fixed it and now it worked_
