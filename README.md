## Hello World!

Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### R G B (color channels) values are continous values between 0.0-1.0, so we need for use float becuase of the decimals.
### _bounces is an int because it's counting how many times the balls has bounced, which can only be in whole numbers (0,1,2). Float is not needed because a ball cannot bounces 1.3 times.
### I'm not sure what the original code looked like...I just know I fixed it and now it worked_

### I am really sick so I couldn't make it to class this week. A main issue I ran into is that no matter what I tried, the text wouldn't show up on the screen. 
### Table 12: Inputs (parameters)
### int choice – which option the player picked (0 = talk, 1 = ask about secret)
### int friendship — current friendship level (e.g., 0–100).
### bool knowsSecret — true if the player knows the character’s secret.
### Output (return type)
### string — the line of text the character says back.
### I think this method takes the minimum inputs required to choose a response and returns the exact thing the UI needs to display.

### W4
### table 12: line 17 checks if player is on the ground. _isGrounded is a member variable, and the type is boolean (bool). This line does not call a method.
### line 28 means that if the player is grounded and is pressing space, then the player will jump
### line 32 means that if the player is in the air (jumping), then it sets a limit to how high the player can go so players can't double jump

### W7
### Step 2 was broken because it only rotated around one axis, so the Muskrat could only move with W/S even though the professor said it should already move with all four WASD keys.
### The code was missing a second rotation using the Muskrat’s up direction, so A/D literally did nothing.
